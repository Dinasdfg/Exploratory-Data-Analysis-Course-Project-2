Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.

The scripts plot1.R to plot6.R produce plots (saved as plot1.png, ...) of the following:

- Total PM2.5 emissions in the United States from 1999 to 2008.
- Total PM2.5 emissions in Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008.
- Total PM2.5 emissions in Baltimore City by type of sources (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) from 1999 to 2008.
- Coal combustion related PM2.5 emissions in the United States from 1999 to 2008.
- Vehicle related PM2.5 emissions in Baltimore City from 1999 to 2008.
- Vehicle related PM2.5 emissions in Baltimore City v LA County from 1999 to 2008.
